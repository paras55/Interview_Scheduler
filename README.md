# Tech Stack , Database and libraries used :

    * Since it was a simple app , I have used SQLite as a database as it is a Relational database and  most widely used for small apps.
    * I have used Flask instead of Django due to time constraints and its flexibility for small apps and API's.
    * SQLalchemy as a wrapper for communicating with Database.
    * Flask-Mail as a mailing service.
